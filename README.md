This project is called fractal fireworks!

This project uses the concepts of fractals and recursion to enhance the visual appeal of fireworks and add another layer to the potential fun and randomization of the concept! 

Brainstorm:

(1) what are your users casually creating

My users will be creating fractal fireworks, but also a firework display over time. Clicking the mouse will generate interesting and randomized fireworks that follow a fractal pattern. They should be able to create a sort of night sky as if they were sitting under a firework display during some fun event. I have always found fractals interesting and a cool visual tool, so I think that they may make for a fun project. 


(2) how do you keep them engaged and excited to create

I hope to keep them engaged and excited to create by having a visually appealing and changing result. Users will be able to click in order to set off fireworks as if they are the ones doing the launching. The system will respond by setting off a firework and will have enough of a degree of randomization that the user should not know exactly what to expect. There should be multiple kinds of fireworks that can combine in different ways, along with different sizes and colors. Users will hopefully be drawn in by the possibilities and excited to continue trying to create new and interesting visuals. Even though there are different fireworks, I think users will experience a state of flow as if they were attending a true firework display. I have personally found myself in a sort of trance watching the sky during these events, and I hope users will be able to induce this sort of flow state in creating their own firework display. Plus they might be waiting around for the one really really big firework to finally go off, which there is a 1/100 chance of happening on every click. 


(3) how do you help them make something they are proud to share

Users will ultimately create a firework display in the form of a single image or sketch over time. As a more fun and meaningful product, users could record their screen for the length of their drawing in order to save the idea of an entire firework display going on with a potential start, middle, and finale! This product could be meaningful or valuable to them for nostalgic reasons, or simply because it creates a feeling of happiness and some sort of wonder. They could also show off their skills in putting on a show, as well as how lucky they got getting really big fireworks to go off at a good time. Perhaps the random firework attributed could even resemble some sort of narrative for the user! Others could experience the same idea of creativity and fun while looking at a created product by the user. Users could best share this product by potentially sharing a video of their entire firework display that they created over any amount of time. This would easily fit on social media or as something like a background or a screensaver for a device. 

Why this system is personally meaningful to me:

This system is personally meaningful to me, because of the nostalgia. Some of my best childhood memories were staying up late to watch the fireworks after the fair on the fourth of July and staring in amazement at the sky. I wanted to allow users to recreate something close to that feeling of wonder I remember experiencing. This program gives the appeal of a bright red sky and the feeling of waiting around for that one big firework to finally go off and light up the entire sky. While my small program could never be as cool as the real thing, it is enough to give me a little sense of joy and put a smile on my face. 


How working on this system challenged me:

Working on this system was challenging for me for a number of reasons. First, getting back into a more object-oriented language like Java was tough for a bit. I felt sluggish with the syntax which was painful for a while. I was also confused about how to keep track of objects in general and over time. I was trying to think like I was coding and animating in Unity, but had to rethink my framework completely and do a lot of looking at outside resources. Having an array of objects to constantly draw was weird, and having those objects act inside the objects themselves instead of from some controller or outside function was also very tricky for me to conceptualize. In addition, it was very hard to wrap my head around recursion in this program and through the firework constructor itself. It took me a while to figure out how to recuse functionally at all. Finally, it was hard to figure out where to use the fractal property after getting recursion working. I tried a bunch of different variables to modify in an attempt to give the fireworks more character and eventually found it acceptable. It was also just hard to try to be really creative as always!

Bugs:

Somehow I have managed to eliminate all bugs obvious to me.

Sources:

I leaned heavily on the given framework from our class which I have saved in my repository as example_circles. I used the same method of initializing an object array and cycling through it since that part of processing was very confusing to me. Due to this, some of the initial structure remains the same as the example. 

I also gained a lot from the following project: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/17259/ 
This project gave me a great deal of insight into moving objects and using translation matrices to explode particles from a point over time. I tried very hard to put my own twist on the idea but used many of the fundamental concepts explored by this project in order to get my basic functionality off the ground.
